According to the game scenario, the player must survive in a dangerous world full of enemies and reach the end of the level within a certain time. The player's goal is to score by destroying the enemies he encounters, escape from deadly traps and reach the exit point at the end of the level in a limited time. There are three different levels in the game, each of which tests the player's skills with increasing difficulty and different enemy structures. The player has three lives and each mistake reduces one of these lives. At the same time, the counter starts counting when the level starts; if the level is not completed before the time runs out, the player is directed to the "Game Over" screen. Each enemy killed earns +10 points and this score is displayed instantly on the screen. The character under the player's control can shoot, jump and move. Additionally, health boosting items and a checkpoint system are integrated into the game.

1) GAME mechanics and systems
--> Player Controls and Movement System

The interaction between the player character is the basis of the game mechanics. The player is given full control with the features of moving horizontally, jumping, wall jumping and directional attack. This structure plays an important role in terms of the fluidity and difficulty balance of the game.

--> Enemy Movement and Damage System

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84259dd2-638e-447d-877f-0daf2acd87ce)
Enemy characters move according to specific routes or trigger events. These movements are linear, repetitive, or timed. They deal damage when they come into contact with the player, creating the game's risk-reward balance.

--> Health, Scoring and Timing Systems

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6db6337e-33ae-4446-9fe7-92b15d63ea1d)
The player's status is tracked through health, score and remaining time. Each time an enemy is destroyed, the score increases, time runs backwards and the player fails when the time runs out. These systems support the game's structure that requires strategic decision making and speed.

--> Winning and Losing Conditions

![rsim1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bea8c2ab-d886-42db-833e-c1367b59e58b)
A game having a completable structure provides motivation for the player to reach the goal. The winning condition is determined by defining an end point that must be reached at the end of the game. This mechanism is evaluated as a concrete result of the progress in the game.

--> Loss Status and Feedback

One of the important elements that balances the gaming experience is the failure state. The game ends when the time runs out or the player loses all their lives. In these scenarios, the situation is clearly expressed by providing visual feedback to the user.

 2) MENU AND USER INTERFACE
--> Main Menu Structure

The main menu that greets the user at the beginning of the game is an important component that determines the first impression of the game. This menu usually includes basic buttons such as "Start Game" and "Exit" and allows the player to interact with the game. The main menu in the project is designed with a simple and user-friendly interface; a functional structure is presented that includes start and exit options.

--> Level Selection Screen

Screens that allow the player to choose which section to play in multi-level games increase the manageability of the game structure. This interface provides the player with the freedom to make direct choices. In the project, a level selection screen was created where levels 1 and 2 can be selected and transitions to the relevant scenes were provided.

--> Audio Settings and UI Indicators

In modern games, it is an important quality element to provide the user with the ability to adjust the volume. Similarly, information such as health, score and time should be presented visually throughout the game. In the project, sound and music levels can be controlled via the user interface; in addition, health status, score and remaining time are displayed on the screen in real time.

--> Level 1

![Level1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b5c2302-80ff-4047-a6df-c7084fddd6c5)
The first level is an introduction to the game with basic movement controls, first enemies, and limited traps. In this stage, basic UI elements such as score, health, and time are on the screen. The interface has a simple and non-distracting structure while providing information to the player.

--> Level 2

![Level2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d35396a8-81cc-4739-859a-7856d06d5edb)
The second level has a more difficult structure than the first level. The frequency of traps increases, and the enemies are more densely placed. The interface structure is the same as Level 1, but due to the level design, there are more areas that require attention. This structure
